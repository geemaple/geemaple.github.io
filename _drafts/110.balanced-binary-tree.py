#
# Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
# 
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
# 
# 
# a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in
# height by no more than 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
# Output: false
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
# -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        return self.helper(root)[0]
            
    def helper(self, node: TreeNode) -> Tuple[bool, int]:
        if node is None:
            return (True, 0)
            
        leftBalance, leftHeight = self.helper(node.left)
        rightBalance, rightHeight = self.helper(node.right)
        
        balance = leftBalance and rightBalance and abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1
        height = max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1
        
        return (balance, height)
